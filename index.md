### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-sal-diaz/blob/main/part-1/sandwich.cc)

Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I had to learn to use functions, strings, and vectors. In this program it's main purpose is to take the input of strings from the user and it adds it into a sentence. This program requires user to enter three arguments protein choice, bread, and condiment.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-sal-diaz-dat-nguyen/blob/main/part-1/rectarea.cc)

Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite program. I learned about functions and using multple files like .h. This particular program calulates the area of a rectangle. 

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-sal-d/tree/main/part-1)

Lab 11 part-1, is another program that I found interesting doing due to implementing classes, member functions. All these components used was for a program to let the user know the total cost of a pizza.
