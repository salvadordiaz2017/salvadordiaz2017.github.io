### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-sal-diaz/blob/main/part-1/sandwich.cc)

Lab 6, part 1, was a favorite because I had to learn to use functions, strings, and vectors. This programâ€™s primary purpose is to take the input of strings from the user and add it into a sentence. This program requires the user to enter three arguments: protein choice, bread, and condiment.

* [Lab 5](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-05-sal-diaz-dat-nguyen/blob/main/part-1/rectarea.cc)

Lab 5, part 1, was one of my favorite programs. I learned about functions and using multiple files like .h. At the beginning of the course, I always wondered why programmers use various files. Thanks to this project, I learned that having multiple files can help organize the program and make it more efficient for reusing, editing, or fixing bugs. This program calculates a rectangle's area when the user inputs the dimensions. 

* [Lab 11](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-11-sal-d/tree/main/part-1)

Lab 11 part 1 is another exciting program due to the implementation of classes and member functions. I learned that using classes and their components is efficient for more complex programs. All these components were used for a program to let the user know the total pizza cost.
