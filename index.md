### CPSC 120

* [Lab 6](https://github.com/cpsc-fall-2023/cpsc-120-lab-06-sal-diaz/blob/main/part-1/sandwich.cc)

Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite because I had to learn to use functions, strings, and vectors. In this program it's main purpose is to take the input of strings from the user and it adds it into a sentence. This program requires user to enter three arguments protein choice, bread, and condiment.
